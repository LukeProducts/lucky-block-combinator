# Lucky Block Combinator
This Python library will help you with crash reports in Minecraft Java Edition, which can be thrown by Lucky Blocks when some block IDs of different Lucky Blocks do not differ. \
This gives an error like "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: The name lootplusplus:blockid has been registered twice". \
With the help of this library you are able to find out which Lucky Blocks are incompatible with which others, \
because you don't know that otherwise and save a lot of effort here. \
If you have found a duplicate registration, you can also modify a Lucky Block without leaving it away so that you rename the objects and no more errors occur.

# Installation
```ruby
pip install lucky-block-combinator
```
